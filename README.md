## Status:
I learned a nice way to get CSS into the extension! I might revisit the slider idea soon.

## TODO:

* ~~Darker color~~
* Add options page
  * *Toggle ON / OFF instead of reload* ^^eh, ^^it's ^^kinda ^^half ^^implemented
  * Custom speed
  * Direction (RtL or LtR)
  * ~~Tooltip showing % scrolled~~
  * ~~Click and drag to scroll page --> move to html range slider~~
  * Dog type
    * Shiba
    * Samoyed
    * Pomeranian
    * ~~Hotdog~~
    * ~~Maybe a cat?~~
    * Maybe a custom image option?
* Fix the disappearing dog? (happens after the tab becomes inactive)

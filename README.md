Scroll progress bar indicator
---

## Status:
I'm thinking about using a input slider as the indicator, but css with js does't like to cooperate with pseudo elements  :(  
As of now, I'm shelfing the idea of click and drag to scroll page via the indicator. After all, *this is* only an indicator, right? ;)

## TODO:

* ~~Darker color~~
* Add options page
  * Toggle ON/OFF instead of reload
  * Custom speed
  * Direction (RtL or LtR)
  * Tooltip showing % scrolled
  * Click and drag to scroll page --> move to html range slider
  * Dog type
    * Shiba
    * Samoyed
    * Pomeranian
    * Hotdog
    * Maybe a cat?
    * Maybe a custom image?
* Fix the disappearing dog? (happens after the tab becomes inactive)

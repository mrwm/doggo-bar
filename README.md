## Status:
There seems to be a box that refuses to be removed unless page is refreshed.  
I'll also need to look into a way to actually remove the pictures upon spawing  
nothing.

## TODO:

* ~~Darker color~~
* Add options page
  * *Toggle ON / OFF instead of reload* <sup>eh, it's kinda half implemented</sup>
  * Custom speed
  * Direction (RtL or LtR)
  * ~~Tooltip showing % scrolled~~
  * ~~Click and drag to scroll page --> move to html range slider~~ [idea placed on hold]
  * Dog type
    * ~~Shiba~~
    * Samoyed
    * Pomeranian
    * ~~Husky~~
    * ~~Hotdog~~
    * ~~Cat (lol)~~
    * Maybe a custom image option?
* Fix the disappearing dog? (happens after the tab becomes inactive)
* Fix annoying empty grey box
